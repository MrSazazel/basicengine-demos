A MOD player extension for Engine BASIC.

After you have executed `loader.bas`, you can play MOD files from BASIC
using the command `|playmod "space_debris.mod"`. You can stop the music with
`|stopmod`.

Demonstrates how to:
- add new functionality to Engine BASIC with modules written in C
- hook audio streams into the mixing system

[This demo requires a "next-generation" BASIC Engine platform (H3 or SDL).]
