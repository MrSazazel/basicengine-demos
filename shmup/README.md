Translation of the [shmup demo from HuC](https://github.com/uli/huc/tree/master/examples/shmup)
to (Engine) BASIC.

The version in `shmup.bas` has been written for the classic BASIC Engine, but
works on next generation systems as well.

The version in `shmup_ng.bas` takes advantage of true color screen modes and
sprite rotation only available on NG platforms.
